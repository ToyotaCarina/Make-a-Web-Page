            <h3>Dilemma</h3>
            <p>
              For almost a year, Karina and Øivind want to buy a Pomeranian dog.
              Well, I think, Karina wants it most.
              After moving to a new town,
              buying an apartment and getting permanent jobs, they thought that buying a dog
              could be a next step in their relationship.
              <br>
              Now it's time to find out, if Pomeranian suits their life style.

              The Pomeranian is a breed of dog of the Spitz type.
              It's classified as a toy dog breed because of small size. Pomeranians have a thick, double coat, which makes them so fluffy!
              However, this coat requires regular grooming.
              They are typically friendly, very active and like to play. They don't relalize they are small so they can try to  verbally threaten large dogs.
              And they do bark a lot. Poms need daily exercise, even it's just a walk around the block.

            <p>
              Both Karina and Øivind are dog persons. So it was no discussion of having a cat.
              Since they live in apartment, a big dog is not a good solution. Of all small breeds, they love Pomeranians most.
              <br>
              They also have a lot of free time they can spend with dog or if they will take a vacation,
              Øivind's mother or co-workers to Karina would loved to babysitting little fluffiness.
              <br>
              Dog is an important dicision, so the couple have bought 3 Lambi plush sheeps to train on.

            <p>
              However, several times Lambi's were completely forgotten at home at vacation time.
              Of course, they can be excused, because Lambies just <em>plush toys</em>.
              They promised to be better with real one.

              Karina and Øivind have a low noize tolerance, and it can be problematic, since Pomeranians loves to bark.
              But since breed are trainable and there is enough of free time, the problem can be mitigated.
              Cause of double coat, Pomeranians prefer rather cold weather than hot. Karina hates cold weather,
              but Øivind is more tolerant to cold, so Karina hopes Øivind can take a walking tours during cold days.
              <br>
              Pomeranian do best with two walks per day and for a duration of at least 20 minutes.
              "Exercise Wants" value for couple is 3, and it shows that couple is not very lazy, but not are very active either.
              20 minutes twice a day should work. Extra activity is very good for health.
              <br>
              Pomeranians should also be trained. High trainability level and good free time works together.

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
              Pomeranian breed is a good match for such couple as Karina and Øivind.
              If they buy a Pomeranian, they will be more social, more active and
              more happy.
